Slidden is an open source, customizable, iOS 8 keyboard, written in Swift.
iOS 8 brought us the ability to create fully customizable keyboards, but does not provide a strong foundation to start from. 
Slidden aims to remedy that by providing an easy way to get started making your own iOS keyboards. 

> Slidden is named after the [Sholes and Glidden typewriter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter), the first commercially successful typewriter and the origin of the QWERTY keyboard.

## Requirements
- Xcode 6
- iOS 7.0+

## Installation
At the current moment, the best installation method is to add Slidden as a git submodule and add `Slidden.framework` to your list of Target Dependencies. 
_Don't forget to add `Slidden.framework` to your keyboard's list of target dependencies as well!_

## Usage

_Coming Soon_
